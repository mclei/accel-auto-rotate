# Auto-rotate

Auto-rotate screen and touchscreen based on accelerometer sensor.

Created for Debian 10 Buster with XFCE4 on One Mix 3s where the autorotate does not work out of box.

It rotates all touchscreen devices found (eg.: touchscreen and pen).

PS: If you know how to enable native autorotate with XFCE4, feel free to contact me on: lei-deb@leisoft.cz.
